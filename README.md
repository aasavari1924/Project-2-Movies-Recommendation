# 🎬 Movies Recommendation System – Project Report
 
📌  Introduction:

In today’s digital world, users are overwhelmed with content choices. A movie recommendation system helps users discover films they are likely to enjoy by analyzing viewing history, preferences, and other user behavior. This project implements a movie recommender using both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

📊  Objective:

1.To develop a recommendation engine that:

2.Suggests relevant movies to users.

3.Learns user preferences from previous interactions.

4.Combines popularity, user ratings, and content similarity.


🛠 Tools & Technologies:

• Programming Language: Python

• ibraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

• Dataset: MovieLens 100k/1M

• Platform: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

📚  Methodology:

1.Data Collection:
   
• Dataset Source: MovieLens

• Contains movies, genres, user ratings, and timestamps.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   
• Handled missing values.

• Normalized rating scales.

• Merged movie metadata (genres, title, year).

3. Recommendation Approaches:
   
A. Popularity-Based Filtering:

• Recommends top-rated or most-watched movies to all users.

B. Content-Based Filtering:

• Based on metadata (genre, director, cast).

• Used TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

C. Collaborative Filtering:

• Memory-based (user-user or item-item similarity).

• Model-based using matrix factorization (SVD from Surprise).

D. Hybrid Model:

• Combines collaborative and content-based recommendations for better personalization.

🖥 Results:

• RMSE for SVD: 0.87 (acceptable for MovieLens 100k)

• Precision@10: 0.72

• Recall@10: 0.64

 
🔍 Challenges:

• Data sparsity in collaborative filtering.

• Cold-start problem for new users or movies.

• Real-time scalability for large datasets.

✅ Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates a working movie recommendation engine using classic and modern approaches. Future improvements could include deep learning-based models and contextual recommendations using user location or time of day.
